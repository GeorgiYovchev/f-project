# Flask Microservices Application Overview

Welcome to our concise yet comprehensive Flask-based microservices system.

## Core Services

- **Frontend Service**: Interfaces with users, handling actions like login and data entry, all through Flask.

- **User Service**: Manages user accounts, authentication, and securely stores data using SQLite.

- **Data Service**: Responsible for storing and retrieving user data, also leveraging SQLite.

## System Design

- **Modular Architecture**: Each service focuses on specific functionalities for better scalability and maintenance.
- **Inter-service Communication**: Achieved via HTTP requests, promoting a decoupled yet cohesive structure.
- **Security & User Experience**: Prioritizes secure data handling and a smooth, intuitive user interface.

This application is a model of efficient microservices design, ideal for exploring modern web architectures and user data management.
